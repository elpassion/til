# Today I Learned

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings.

A TIL is a short document (a few sentences + example code) describing 
a syntax, command, keyboard shortcut, or anything new or surprising that you've recently learned.

See [Contributing] for instructions on how to write and add new TIL.
